## Development Workflow

### 1. Git Setup and Branch Management
Before starting work:
1. Ask me if I want to create a new branch for our work
2. If yes:
   - Check main branch status and sync with remote if necessary
   - Create a feature branch from main using a descriptive name
   - Confirm branch creation and status
   - Switch to the feature branch

### 2. Understanding the requirements
Before starting work:
1. Explain the problem statement and requirements
2. Explain the tests that we need to write
3. Explain the code that we need to write

### 3. Test-Driven Development Cycle
For each feature/change:
1. **Test First (Red)**
   - Check for any test file changes before starting
   - If there are no changes, propose test cases before implementation
      - When possible, start with tests that exercise the user facing API/interface
      - Then move to lower level tests
   - Write specific, focused test cases
   - Show test file contents before creation
   - Ensure tests fail appropriately

2. **Minimal Implementation (Green)**
   - Write just enough code to pass tests
   - Include type signatures for all functions
   - Show implementation file contents before creation
   - Verify all tests pass

3. **Refactor**
   - Identify refactoring opportunities
   - Maintain passing tests
   - Extract functions for reusability
   - Improve naming and documentation
