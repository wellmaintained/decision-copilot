# Decision Copilot Specifications

This document provides an overview of all specification documents for the Decision Copilot application. These specifications serve as a reference for developers working on the system and define the expected behavior of different components.

## Specifications by Domain

| Domain | Specification | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** | [MCP Overview](specs/mcp-overview.md) | Overview of MCP integration for AI agent interaction |
| | [MCP Resources](specs/mcp-resources.md) | Resources exposed through MCP for data access |
| | [MCP Tools](specs/mcp-tools.md) | Tools exposed through MCP for interactive operations |
| | [MCP Authentication](specs/mcp-authentication.md) | Authentication and authorization for MCP |
| | [MCP API Endpoint](specs/mcp-api-endpoint.md) | Server-Sent Events endpoint implementation |
| | [MCP Implementation](specs/mcp-implementation.md) | Implementation plan for MCP integration |

## Understanding the Specifications

Each specification document follows a standard format:

1. **Introduction**: Describes the purpose and scope of the specification
2. **Details**: Provides in-depth information about the feature or component
3. **Implementation**: Offers guidance on how to implement the specification
4. **Examples**: Illustrates usage with concrete examples where applicable
5. **References**: Links to related specifications or external resources

## Key Architectural Principles

All specifications adhere to these core architectural principles:

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear separation of domain models, repositories, and infrastructure
2. **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout the application
3. **Immutability**: Domain objects are immutable to prevent unexpected state changes
4. **Validation**: Domain-level validation ensures data integrity
5. **Repository Pattern**: Data access through repository interfaces
6. **Organization Scoping**: Data is scoped to organizations for security

## Development Workflow

When implementing these specifications:

1. Review the relevant specification documents
2. Follow the implementation guidance provided
3. Write tests that verify the behavior matches the specification
4. Submit a pull request for review
5. Update the specification if changes are needed during implementation

## Contributing to Specifications

To improve or expand these specifications:

1. Propose changes through pull requests
2. Ensure changes align with architectural principles
3. Update all affected specifications to maintain consistency
4. Include examples and implementation guidance for new features
